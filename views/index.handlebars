            <p> <strong>Hi.</strong> I'm Kathryn.</p>
            <p>I'm so happy you've stopped by. I currently live and work in Dallas, but I'm a Philadelphia girl at
                heart. I work with a fantasic team in Business Development at <a href="http://tm.com/">TM Advertising</a>,
                where I spend most of my daytime writing RPFs, press releases, social posts and internal communications
                documents. It's a fast-paced and fun industry that has taught me to embrace the challenges and
                excitments of the every day.</p>
            <p> My real passion, though, is spending every free moment outside - cycling, running, hiking, skiing,
                traveling. Enjoying the world we live in. I truly believe that everything we could every dream of
                having, achieving, experiencing or feeling already exists, just waiting for us to realize it.
                Everything is now. I try to live every day with this in mind.</p>
            <p> Poke around my first site and don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
